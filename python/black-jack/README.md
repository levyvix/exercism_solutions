# Black Jack

Welcome to Black Jack on Exercism's Python Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Instructions

In this exercise you are going to implement some rules of [Blackjack][blackjack],
such as the way the game is played and scored.

**Note** : In this exercise, _`A`_ means ace, _`J`_ means jack, _`Q`_ means queen, and _`K`_ means king.
Jokers are discarded.
A [standard French-suited 52-card deck][standard_deck] is assumed, but in most versions, several decks are shuffled together for play.

## 1. Calculate the value of a card

In Blackjack, it is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11 points (_more on that later_).
Face cards (`J`, `Q`, `K`) are scored at 10 points and any other card is worth its "pip" (_numerical_) value.

Define the `value_of_card(<card>)` function with parameter `card`.
The function should return the _numerical value_ of the passed-in card string.
Since an ace can take on multiple values (1 **or** 11), this function should fix the value of an ace card at 1 for the time being.
Later on, you will implement a function to determine the value of an ace card, give an existing hand.

```python
>>> value_of_card('K')
10

>>> value_of_card('4')
4

>>> value_of_card('A')
1
```

## 2. Determine which card has a higher value

Define the `higher_card(<card_one>, <card_two>)` function having parameters `card_one` and `card_two`.
For scoring purposes, the value of `J`, `Q` or `K` is 10.
The function should return which card has the higher value for scoring.
If both cards have an equal value, return both.
Returning both cards can be done by using a comma in the `return` statement:

```python
# Using a comma in a return creates a Tuple.  Tuples will be covered in a later exercise.
>>> def returning_two_values(value_one, value_two):
        return value_one, value_two

>>> returning_two_values('K', '3')
('K', '3')
```

An ace can take on multiple values, so we will fix `A` cards to a value of 1 for this task.

```python
>>> higher_card('K', '10')
('K', '10')

>>> higher_card('4', '6')
'6'

>>> higher_card('K', 'A')
'K'
```

## 3. Calculate the value of an ace

As mentioned before, an ace can be worth _either_ 1 **or** 11 points.
Players try to get as close as possible to a score of 21, without going _over_ 21 (_going "bust"_).

Define the `value_of_ace(<card_one>, <card_two>)` function with parameters `card_one` and `card_two`, which are a pair of cards already in the hand _before_ getting an ace card.
Your function will have to decide if the upcoming ace will get a value of 1 or a value of 11, and return that value.
Remember: the value of the hand with the ace needs to be as high as possible _without_ going over 21.

**Hint**: if we already have an ace in hand then it's value would be 11.

```python
>>> value_of_ace('6', `K`)
1

>>> value_of_ace('7', '3')
11
```

## 4. Determine a "Natural" or "Blackjack" Hand

If the first two cards a player is dealt are an ace (`A`) and a ten-card (10, `K`, `Q` or `J`), giving a score of 21 in two cards, the hand is considered a `natural` or `blackjack`.

Define the `is_blackjack(<card_one>, <card_two>)` function with parameters `card_one` and `card_two`, which are a pair of cards.
Determine if the two-card hand is a `blackjack`, and return the boolean `True` if it is, `False` otherwise.

**Note** : The score _calculation_ can be done in many ways.
But if possible, we'd like you to check if there is an ace and a ten-card **_in_** the hand (or at a certain position), as opposed to _summing_ the hand values.

```python
>>> is_blackjack('A', 'K')
True

>>> is_blackjack('10', '9')
False
```

## 5. Splitting pairs

If the players first two cards are of the same value, such as two sixes, or a `Q` and `K` a player may choose to treat them as two separate hands.
This is known as "splitting pairs".

Define the `can_split_pairs(<card_one>, <card_two>)` function with parameters `card_one` and `card_two`, which are a pair of cards.
Determine if this two-card hand can be split into two pairs.
If the hand can be split, return the boolean `True` otherwise, return `False`

```python
>>> can_split_pairs('Q', 'K')
True

>>> can_split_pairs('10', 'A')
False
```

## 6. Doubling down

When the original two cards dealt total 9, 10, or 11 points, a player can place an additional bet equal to their original bet.
This is known as "doubling down".

Define the `can_double_down(<card_one>, <card_two>)` function with parameters `card_one` and `card_two`, which are a pair of cards.
Determine if the two-card hand can be "doubled down", and return the boolean `True` if it can, `False` otherwise.

```python
>>> can_double_down('A', '9')
True

>>> can_double_down('10', '2')
False
```
